- [ ]fix the lack of any charge input
- [ ]examine noise output from the two voltage regulators more closely
- [ ]add chokes or lpf to the outputs of the converters for better noise
- [ ]look into adding pcb shielding

(as you can see i HATE noisy circuits)

- [ ]determine the best way to power the circuit externally(although it likely wont be used much)
- [ ]shrink the width of the pcb by 0.1"
- [ ]dual sided components
- [ ]make it possible to attach the SIM7080G with the raspberry pi pico
- [ ]fix the incorrectly sized sma pads OR find a better antenna attachment method
